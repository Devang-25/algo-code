Types of replication:
    On a higher level :
    -------------------
    1. Push replication
    2. pull replication


    On a finer level :
    --------------------
    Writes are only made to the master or root node.
    1. Master - slave
    2. Master - Master
    3. Buddy replication -
        Buddy Replication allows you to suppress replicating your data to all instances
        in a cluster. Instead, each instance picks one or more 'buddies' in the cluster,
        and only replicates to these specific buddies.
    4. Tree Replication

    Replication in Microsofts SQL Server
    ------------------------------------
    Snapshot replication :
        used when data changes infrequently
    Transaction replication :
        Used when data changes frequently. Only the diffs from previous snapshots are transferred
        to the subscribers.
    Merge replication:
    Similar to transactional but the synchronization doesn't happen for every change, but happens when
    some event is triggered like when the client reads the data -> goes offline -> makes changes and then return online
    and wants to commit those changes to the main database. (similar to code merging).




Locking: Optimistic and Pessimistic locking:
Optimisitic locking takes a version number of the record and before updating that record, checks if the version has not changed
Pessimistic locking locks the entire record so other client can access it before the current update is finished.
